<h2>A brief summary ofSubhash Chandra Bose's journey</h2>
<h3>Early life and education</h3>
<p>
    Subhas Chandra Bose was born to Prabhavati Bose (n√©e Dutt) and Janakinath Bose on 23 January 1897 in Cuttack‚Äîin what is today the state of Odisha in India, but was then the Orissa Division of Bengal Province in British India.<br>
  Eager to join his five school-going older brothers, Subhas entered the Baptist Mission's Protestant European School in Cuttack in January 1902.<br>
     Subhas Bose followed his five brothers again 1913 to Presidency College, Calcutta, the historic and traditional college for Bengal's upper-caste Hindu men. He chose to study philosophy, his readings including Kant, Hegel, Bergson and other Western philosophers.<br>
    He then was sent by his parents to the University of Cambridge in England to prepare for the Indian Civil Service. In 1920 he passed the civil service examination, but in April 1921, after hearing of the nationalist turmoils in India, he resigned his candidacy and hurried back to India. Throughout his career, especially in its early stages, he was supported financially and emotionally by an elder brother, Sarat Chandra Bose (1889‚Äì1950), a wealthy Calcutta lawyer and Indian National Congress (also known as the Congress Party) politician.He then was sent by his parents to the University of Cambridge in England to prepare for the Indian Civil Service.

</p>
<h3>Subhash Chandra Bose & Indian National Congress</h3>
<p>
   He joined the Non Cooperation Movement, which Mahatma Gandhi founded and turned into a potent non-violent movement. Mahatma Gandhi recommended he collaborate with Chittaranjan Das, who later served as his political mentor, during the agitation. Following that, he worked as a youth educator and volunteer commander for the Bengal Congress. He founded the ‚ÄúSwaraj‚Äù newspaper. After being released from prison in 1927, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose joined the Congress party as general secretary and fought for independence with Jawaharlal Nehru.<br>
  At the time of the Civil Disobedience Movement Bose was in detention for linking with a Bengal revolutionary group. He became the Mayor of Calcutta while in prison. Thereafter he was released and detained several times on suspected links to revolutionary groups. Finally, he was released on grounds of poor health and allowed by the government to go to Europe. He returned from Europe in 1936 and remained in detention for about a year.<br>

After being elected president of the Indian National Congress in 1938, he established a national planning committee and developed a wide industrialization agenda. However, Gandhian economic theory, which stuck to the idea of cottage industries and profiting from the utilization of the nation‚Äôs own resources, did not agree with this. When Subhash Chandra Bose won his reelection bid in 1939 over a Gandhian opponent, it served as vindication for him. Nevertheless, the ‚Äúrebel president‚Äù felt compelled to step down because Gandhi didn‚Äôt back him.
</p>
<h3>Azad Hind Fauz or Indian National Army (INA)</h3>
<p>
    The establishment and efforts of the Azad Hind Fauj commonly referred to as the Indian National Army, or INA, during the Second World War were a significant development in the struggle for liberation. With the help of Indians living in Southeast Asian nations, Rash Behari Bose, an Indian revolutionary who had fled his country and spent many years living in Japan, founded the Indian Independence League.

The league created the Indian National Army from among the Indian POWs with the intention of releasing India from British domination after Japan defeated the British army and seized nearly all of the Southeast Asian nations. The organization of this force was greatly aided by General Mohan Singh, a former officer in the British Indian army.

Subhash Chandra Bose, who was working for India‚Äôs independence, fled India in 1941 and went to Germany. He arrived in Singapore in 1943 to head the Indian Independence League and develop the Indian National Army (Azad Hind Fauj) into a powerful tool for India‚Äôs freedom. About 45,000 soldiers made up the Azad Hind Fauj, including Indian prisoners of war and Indians who had settled in various Southeast Asian nations.<br>
  Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose announced the establishment of the provisional administration of independent India (Azad Hind) in Singapore on October 21, 1943. In the Andaman, which the Japanese had previously occupied, Netaji raised the Indian flag. Three units of the Azad Hind Fauj (INA) took part in the offensive on northeastern India at the beginning of 1944 in an effort to drive the British out of the country. The warriors who had entered India, according to Shah Nawaz Khan, one of the most important Azad Hind Fauj officers, lay flat on the ground and fervently worshipped the precious soil of their motherland. However, Azad Hind Fauj‚Äôs attempt to liberate India was unsuccessful.

The Japanese government was not seen as a friend of India by the Indian nationalist movement. It felt sympathy for the citizens of those nations that had suffered because of Japan‚Äôs invasion. But according to Netaji, British control over India might be overthrown with the cooperation of the Japanese-backed Azad Hind Fauj and an uprising within the country. Indians both inside and outside of the nation found inspiration in the Azad Hind Fauj, which was known for its ‚ÄúDelhi Chalo‚Äù slogan and salutation. For the sake of India‚Äôs freedom, Netaji joined forces with Indians from all regions and denominations who were residing in Southeast Asia.

Indian women made significant contributions to the fight for India‚Äôs independence. The Azad Hind Fauj organized a women‚Äôs unit, which Captain Lakshmi Swaminathan oversaw. The regiment‚Äôs name was Rani Jhansi. The Azad Hind Fauj came to represent unity and bravery among Indians. A few days after Japan‚Äôs surrender, Netaji, one of the most influential figures in India‚Äôs battle for independence, was declared dead in an aviation crash.

Fascist Germany and Italy were defeated in 1945, bringing an end to the Second World War. In the war, millions of people died. The United States of America launched atomic bombs on the two cities of Japan, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki when the war was drawing to a close and Italy and Germany had already been vanquished. These cities were completely destroyed and approximately 200,000 people were dead in a matter of seconds. Japan gave up shortly after this. Despite the fact that the use of atomic weapons ended the war, it also caused new global tensions and a new race to develop increasing weapons that may take out all of humanity.
</p>
<h3>Death</h3>
<p>
    Subhash Chandra Bose died on August 18, 1945, in a plane crash the INA forces were being captured or surrendered and he was en route to Tokyo through Taiwan. On August 18, 1945, Subhash Chandra Bose reportedly perished in an aeroplane collision over Taipeh, Taiwan (Formosa).

There isn‚Äôt a lot of information available, despite the widespread belief that he survived the plane disaster.
